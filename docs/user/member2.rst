Game Friend Finding
-------------------

Most of the University students play video games, table games or sport games to relax and spend their leisure time. However, it is not easy to find congenial playmates, especially in the busy campus life. Therefore, students who are looking for playmates could post a message in this section that could be seen by others. In this way, they can easily find some playmates and this would help students in building new friendships and socialization.

In this page users can supply information about new Game Friend Finding entries and publish these announcements to all the website users.
