			<div class="col-md-4" style="margin:0px;border-radius:0.3rem">

					There are students who are bad at some university subjects and therefore in need of private tutors. In addition, there are students who are good at these subjects and could tutor the weaker students. Therefore, the website has a section to arrange the contact and meeting of those students with each other. The parts in the section are the university subjects, the students who would like to find a tutor for the subject(s) they would like to be supported and the possible tutor candidates.

					Many ITU students live in student house and sometimes, it can be difficult to find a home or room. The website brings together people who are looking for a home or a room and people who want to share a house or a room.

					The quality and the price of meals is very important for every student. Therefore, the website has an evaluation system for the quality and prices of the meals at every restaurant and cafeteria in the university. The users are able to sort the places according to their prices and users' evaluations through using it. In addition, the problem of lacking information about the structure and content of meals in the refectory would be solved by placing the photos of every single meal and the users' evaluation forms in the system.

					There is a section in the website for the users who search for their lost properties and the users who would like to share the time and place information about the properties they found. The records will also contain the date. Therefore, students would only need to check the system to find out whether their lost properties had been found. The people only need to check the system for their lost properties. This will result a considerable advantage because most of the time people do not remember the exact time and places where they lost their properties.

					There is also a section, which could help students to find playmates. The reason for this is that university students mostly play games, including table games and video games, to relax and spend their leisure time. However, it is not easy to find congenial playmates, especially in the busy campus life. Therefore, students who are looking for playmates could post a message in this section that could be seen by others. As a consequence, they could contact each other so that determine the place and time for playing a table game like backgammon and uno, or they could decide to play a multiplayer video games. This would help students in building new friendships and socialization.
